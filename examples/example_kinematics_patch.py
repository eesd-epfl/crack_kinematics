This script contains examples of how to run the algorithm. Here, given a binary image
and its container folder path, the kinematic is computed in the closest skeleton point
to an image coordinate. The image coordinate can be given beforehand o during the process
by clicking over the image. The functions crop a window with given size in the original 
binary image around the image coordinate. Check functions for more details.
